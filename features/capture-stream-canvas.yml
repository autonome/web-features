name: captureStream() for <canvas>
description: The `captureStream()` method for `<canvas>` elements returns a `MediaStream` which includes a `CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack` containing a real-time video capture of the contents of the canvas. Firefox doesn't support `CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack`, but has `CanvasCaptureMediaStream` which is equivalent.
