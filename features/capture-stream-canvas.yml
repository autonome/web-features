# TODO: Add notes about captureStream() being supported in Firefox, but not
# CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack. Instead there's CanvasCaptureMediaStream, so it
# would be possible to write code that works in Firefox. See
# https://bugzil.la/1231131.
compat_features:
  - api.CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack
  - api.CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack.canvas
  - api.CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack.requestFrame
